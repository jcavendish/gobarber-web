## 🗒Sobre
**GoBarber** is a platform where barbers publish their services so clients find these barbers and make appointments with them. The application manages all the barber's schedule, and the client is only able to create a new appointment within the available hours.

**GoBarber Web** is a ReactJS interface to interact with barbers. It is the professional panel where barbers can see their next appointments.
